# MMDAgent-EX

MMDAgent-EX is a research and development platform for spoken dialogue systems, multi-modal interactions and avatar communications using CG avatars. It has been open-sourced since December 2023, with [CG Avatar Gene & Uka](https://www.slp.nitech.ac.jp/en/avatar/).

> The notation can be either **MMDAgent-EX** or **MMD-Agent EX**. The "MMD" part has a double meaning, representing both "Multi-Modal Dialogue" and "MikuMikuDance". We call it “Em-Em-Dee-Agent E-X”.
